RUNNING

You must have rpcbind up and running (in some distros you need to start rpcbind with the option -i)

KNOWN BUGS

- You can't win, the server doesn't detect a stalemate
- As Player Black you will see the board only if White make his first move
- The Game doesn't terminate well, so you don't notice if one player disconnect, a reconnect is not possible
- Only two player, the first one will always be White
